/*

Below class is to represent heaps

Firstly let us understand what is min heap and what is max heap

Max Heap :

                       100

           90                       80

      70       60             50          40

In array : | 100 | 90 | 80 | 70 | 60 | 50 | 40 |

In max heap, the node should be greater than or equal to its descendents


Min Heap :

                        10

             20                     30

         40      50             60       70

In array :  | 10 | 20 | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 |

In min heap, the node should be smaller than or equal to its descendents

Now lets see an implementation of Max heap below, Min heap is just another variation of heap
