/*

Priority queue is queue, where you add and remove elements similar to queue
But it is not FIFO.

Here the number is removed is as per priority.
Highest priority or least priority should be removed first.

So priority queues can be implemented using Heap.
Since using Min heap or Max heap based on the requirement, we can implement priorityQueue.
Using heap we can achieve insertion and deletion in log(n) time.
